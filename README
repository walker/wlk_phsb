This is a plugin for Textpattern built by Walker Hamilton (http://walkerhamilton.com) that enables the use of PubSubHubBub protocol to announcu when new content has been posted to the weblog.

The publisher class was written by Josh Frazer (joshfraser.com) before being modified slightly for use here. Josh also wrote the Wordpress plugin that I based this plugin on. Also, I got alot of the issues that needed to be figured out dealt with when building wlk_rsscloud.

To install, grab the current version of the compressed plugin (wlk_phsb.txt) and paste into the plugin field in Textpattern.

As long as it's been installed & activated, you're ready to go.

This has been tested with 4.2.0 only. It requires CURL.
